# The Informant

**Informant** is a JavaScript library for building highly customized data visualizations and embedding them wherever scripting is enabled. From a single widget to a full-fledged reporting dashboard, Informant takes an component-based approach that provides maximum flexibility. It is driven by the power of [Analyst](/lytics/analyst), which allows for the asynchronous loading and manipulation of any data source with a JSON enabled API. Informant depends on [d3](http://d3js.org/) and [dc.js](http://nickqizhu.github.com/dc.js/) for its charting and data visualization.

For API documentation and more, see the [wiki](/lytics/informant/wiki).
